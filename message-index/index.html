title: The Haskell Error Index

<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>
  This site describes the various messages that can be returned by Haskell-related tools, including both errors and warnings.
  For example GHC, the most-commonly-used Haskell implementation, started emiting a code with the format <code>[GHC-12345]</code> for its
  messages in version 9.6.1.
  These codes can be looked up below for further information.
</p>

<p>
  So far, $messageCount$ errors and warnings are documented here.
  If you encounter a message that is not yet documented, please
  <a href="https://github.com/haskellfoundation/error-message-index/issues">open an issue</a> or
  <a href="https://github.com/haskellfoundation/error-message-index/pulls">submit a pull request with documentation</a>.
  Pull requests with additional examples and improved explanations for
  existing messages are also very welcome, as are
  <a href="https://github.com/haskellfoundation/error-message-index/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acss">improvements to the generated site</a>.
