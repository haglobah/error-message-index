title: The Haskell Error Index | GHCup
---

<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>
  This site describes error messages that can be returned by <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/">GHCup</a>, including both errors and warnings.
  Every error and warning has a code that GHCup emits when you run into itâ€”you can look them up below.
</p>

<p>
  So far, $messageCount$ GHCup errors and warnings are documented here.
  If you encounter a message that is not yet documented, please
  <a href="https://github.com/haskellfoundation/error-message-index/issues">open an issue</a> or
  <a href="https://github.com/haskellfoundation/error-message-index/pulls">submit a pull request with documentation</a>.
  Pull requests with additional examples and improved explanations for
  existing messages are also very welcome, as are
  <a href="https://github.com/haskellfoundation/error-message-index/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acss">improvements to the generated site</a>.
